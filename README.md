data-structure-and-algo is a collection of data structure and algorithm implementations written in Python (and extendable to other languages). The goal of this repository is to build a strong foundation in DSA concepts while maintaining readable, well-documented, and beginner-friendly code.

It will cover:
1) Data Structures → Arrays, Linked Lists, Stacks, Queues, Trees, Graphs, Hashing, Heaps, etc.
2) Algorithms → Sorting, Searching, Recursion, Divide & Conquer, Dynamic Programming, Greedy, Backtracking, Graph Algorithms, and more.

Each implementation will include:

- Step-by-step explanation
- Time & space complexity

Example usage

- This repo is designed to help:
- Students preparing for coding interviews
- Developers brushing up on fundamentals
- Anyone interested in learning DSA through code
